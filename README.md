piptools
========

PIP Tools (PIP Review and PIP Dumps), pip-review checks PyPI and reports available updates. It uses the list of currently installed packages to check for updates. Dont overwrite packages, just reports. pip-dump dumps the exact versions of installed packages in your active environment to your requirements.txt file. Dont overwrite packages, just reports. If you have more than one file matching the *requirements.txt pattern (for example dev-requirements.txt), it will update each of them smartly. Requisites: sudo pip install pip-tools
